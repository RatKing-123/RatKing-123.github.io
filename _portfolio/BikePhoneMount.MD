 This syringe‬‭ pump‬‭ is powered‬‭ by‬‭ a‬‭ motor‬ coupled‬‭ to‬‭ a‬‭ lead‬‭ screw.‬‭ Key‬‭ design‬‭ considerations‬‭ include‬‭ adaptability‬‭ to‬‭ varying‬‭ syringe‬
‭ diameters‬‭ and‬‭ adjustable‬‭ flow‬‭ rates.‬‭ Additionally,‬‭ the‬‭ syringe‬‭ pump‬‭ incorporates‬‭ status‬‭ lights‬‭ for‬
‭ operational‬‭ feedback,‬‭ a‬‭ latching‬‭ button‬‭ for‬‭ control,‬‭ and‬‭ a‬‭ limit‬‭ switch‬‭ to‬‭ halt‬‭ motion‬‭ when‬‭ the‬
‭ plunger reaches its limit.

In this cross-sectional view of the detent mechanism, you can see the 7 mm ball bearing and 8x10 mm compressional spring that allow the phone to snap into vertical and horizontal orientations.
