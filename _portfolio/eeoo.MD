### Print-in-Place Pliers

### About the Design
For my assignment, the objective was to filament print pliers capable of gripping and picking up through-hole resistors. 
The requirements are that the pliers return to the open position when not in use, and they have to be assembled 
by hand using no tools.

I modeled my design after the design in the 2017 [article by Bulent Yusef](https://all3dp.com/3d-printed-flexible-pliers/). 
For the handles and jaws, I used PLA filament. For the flexible centerpiece I used 95A TPU and a grid pattern with 0.75 mm 
wide lines. I found this to be the perfect balance of flexibility and durability for the spring component of the pliers. 
It’s connected to the rigid handles and jaws with an interlocking pattern that fits together tightly (shown below).

### Specifications
The jaws are 60 mm long and have a capacity of mm, meaning they can open up to mm wide.
