## Generative Design & Powder Bed Fusion


This pairing is complementary because:
- Generative design/topology optimization can propose highly efficient geometries (thin ribs, branching struts, lattices), minimizing mass while meeting stiffness/strength constraints.
- Metal powder bed fusion is one of the few production-capable processes that can actually manufacture those complex internal/organic geometries without tooling, and with fine feature control—so the “weird” shapes that are optimal on a solver aren’t automatically disqualified by manufacturability.

This combo shines in aerospace and automotive when you want some mix of lightweighting, part consolidation, high performance per weight, and shorter iteration cycles.

### [Divergent BrakeNode](https://www.divergent3d.com/applications/automotive)
This example features an integrated brake caliper and suspension upright, enabling improved braking performance and up to a 40% reduction in unsprung mass versus a conventional caliper & upright package.

Although the “final form” involves multiple printed nodes + tubes/rods, the design philosophy is still assembly simplification. With the BrakeNode, Divergent reduces tooling and consolidates structure/function into fewer, more optimized elements.
